- **Private Chat**: Use the `/chat <ID>` command to initiate a private conversation with a specific user.

### Sample Commands
- `/chat 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000` - Start a private chat with the specified ID.
- `<message>` - Send a message globally or privately depending on the chat state.

## Architecture Overview üé®

### Key Components

1. **SocketChannel**:
   - Manages client-to-server communication.

2. **UUID Generation**:
   - Generates unique IDs for clients based on their usernames.

3. **ExecutorService**:
   - Handles concurrent tasks for sending and receiving messages.

4. **ByteBuffer**:
   - Efficiently processes message data.

## Example Interaction

1. **Startup**:
   ```
   Name: JohnDoe
   To connect with your friend, share your ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
   ```

2. **Global Messaging**:
   ```
   JohnDoe: Hello everyone!
   ```

3. **Private Chat**:
   ```
   /chat 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001
   You are now in a private chat with 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001
